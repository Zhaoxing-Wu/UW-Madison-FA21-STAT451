## Project Abstract
This project aims to help banks predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit marketed through the channel of phone calls as well as improve the marketing conversion rate by targeting a certain population of clients. The dataset used[2] is from a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution, with 41188 observations, 20 features, and a binary target variable of a clientâ€™s subscription response. With logistic regression as the baseline model, this project compares KNN, Adaboost, Xgboost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores. The results show that a balanced Decision Tree classifier is highly recommended for prediction and banks should aim at the population with higher income, more advanced educational background, and age group of twenties, thirties, sixties and seventies when advertising through phone calls.
